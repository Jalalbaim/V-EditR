# V-EditR

V-EditR — a reasoning-first image editor powered by a Vision–Language Model.

---

## Why this matters

Image editing tools today often fails on requests that require understanding relations, counts, or context. For example:

- “Add two red cars next to the blue truck.”
- “Make the person holding the phone wear a black jacket.”

Existing tools frequently add or change the wrong elements because they react to style cues rather than reasoning about the scene.

## What V-EditR aims to do

- Interpret free-form instructions and identify what and where to edit.
- Reason about relations (next to, behind), counts, and object identity.
- Apply precise edits (add, remove, modify) without disturbing unrelated content.
